# Balloons-in-a-Box
This project simulates placing balloons inside a 3D box and calculates the remaining space after filling it. It focuses on understanding spatial arrangement and volume computation through Python-based simulation.

Features

Calculates the box and balloon volumes using coordinate inputs.

Finds the maximum fitting volume for each balloon placement.

Displays a 3D visualization of the box and balloons using Matplotlib.

How It Works

User provides the corner coordinates of the box and the centers of the balloons.

The program calculates the remaining volume after placing the balloons.

A 3D visualization is generated to show the placement and remaining space.
